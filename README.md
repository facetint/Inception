# ðŸš€ Inception

The Inception project challenges you to design a secure and modular infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. The goal is to configure several isolated services that communicate via Docker networks, with NGINX acting as a single secure entry point.

## What is Docker?

  You can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.


  Docker is written in the Go programming language and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.

These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.
